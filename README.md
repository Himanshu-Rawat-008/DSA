Data Structures And Algorithms Practice

Run Code -

    1- Install Java Extension Pack and Code Runner Extension from VS Code Extensions.

    2- Edit your java home location in VS Code settings, "java.home": "C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-9.0.4".

    3- Check if javac is recognized in VS Code internal terminal. If this check fails, try opening VS Code as administrator.

    4- Create a simple Java program in Main.java file as:

```java
        public class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                System.out.println("Hello world");     
            }
}
```
    Note: Do not add package in your main class.

    5- Right click anywhere on the java file and select run code.

    6- Check the output in the console.
