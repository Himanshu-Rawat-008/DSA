Important condition for this:

1. majority element will always exists

2. majority element will be more than |n/3| times where n is size of given array

we have to find majority element.

What we can get from question is this :-
 
 > number of majority element will be 1 or 2

 > majority element will exist more than n/3 times that means
 for given range (i < i + n/3 < n), starting element and ending element has to be same

 Now you can look at the solution. Based on these conditions, I have solved this problem.
